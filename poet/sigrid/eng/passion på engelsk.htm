PASSION<BR><BR>

I do not want to,<BR>
yet I must<BR><BR>

Plunge<BR>
into cold water<BR><BR>

What can I trust?
<BR>
The beauty of cancer-patients<BR>
bereft of superstitious joy,<BR><BR>

Their human faces<BR>
gave more peace<BR>
than others'.<BR><BR>

I missed them when they had gone home.<BR>
Their treatment had succeeded<BR>
or had passed<BR>
in vain.<BR>
I washed their floors.<BR>
<BR>
Will I be drifting to a cancer-ward
<BR>or to poetic sadness<BR>
Risk stripping off of all<BR>
my superfluous play?<BR>
<BR>
Eyes, eyes<BR><BR>

Deep seas to refugees.<BR><BR>

Hers wasn't cancer<BR>
She had lifelong pain<BR>
resulting from childbirth.<BR>
