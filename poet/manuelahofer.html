<h1 class=heading>Dikt av Manuela Hofer</h1>

<b>Always back 2 you</b><p>

Even if I go, sometimes,<br>
even if I leave,<br>
even if I wander off,<br>
to explore and see,<br>
what I'll miss,<br>
and what could be;<p>

I always seem to end up,<br>
right here,<p>

I just had to realize,<br>
I just had to know,<br>
that I'm still in paradise,<br>
and were I belong;<br>
in your presence,<br>
in your arms,<br>
you're the only one.<p>

I always seem to end up,<br>
right here with you,<br>
always back to you.<p>

Even if I go, sometimes,<br>
even if I leave,<br>
even if I wander off,<br>
to explore and see;<br>
what I'll miss,<br>
and what could be,<p>

I always seem to end up,<br>
right here.<br>
Always back to you.<p>

I always seem to end up,<br>
right here with you.<p>

Always back to you.<p>
